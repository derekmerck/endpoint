# Python Data Endpoint Library

Derek Merck  
Summer 2020  

Collection of utilities for managing information endpoints with CRUD accessors.

Deriving a class from Endpoint, RestAgent, and Serializable creates a highly functional class that can be instantiated from fixed keywords, has access to persistent data (authentication tokens, indexes, etc.), and connect to specific APIs in order to move or process data.

RestAgent and other utilities are applicable in other domains as well, so this code library is intended to be included in other projects as a git submodule.
